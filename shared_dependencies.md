Shared Dependencies:

1. **Database Connection**: All the files will share a common database connection. This will be defined in the `database.py` file of each agent. The connection details like database name, username, password, host, and port will be shared across all the files.

2. **API Endpoints**: The `api.py` file in each agent will define the API endpoints that the frontend will use to interact with the backend. These endpoints will be shared across all the files.

3. **Main Function**: The `main.py` file in each agent will contain the main function that will be the entry point of the application. This function will be shared across all the files.

4. **Data Schemas**: The data schemas for the database will be shared across all the files. These will define the structure of the data that will be stored in the database.

5. **DOM Element IDs**: The frontend will use specific DOM element IDs to interact with the HTML elements. These IDs will be shared across all the files.

6. **Message Names**: The message names used for logging and error handling will be shared across all the files.

7. **Function Names**: The function names used in the `main.py`, `database.py`, and `api.py` files will be shared across all the files. These function names will be used to call the specific functions in the code.

8. **API Keys**: The API keys used to interact with the external APIs (like finance/investment APIs, calendar APIs, real estate APIs, etc.) will be shared across all the files.

9. **Python Libraries**: The Python libraries used in the code (like SQL libraries, NLP libraries, etc.) will be shared across all the files.
